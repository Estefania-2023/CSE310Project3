# Overview

This project is a console-based Student Gradebook designed to strengthen my Java and object-oriented programming skills. It allows users to add students, manage and update grades, view averages, and save or load data from a file. The goal was to practice real-world programming concepts such as data management, user interaction, file handling, and the use of core Java features including variables, conditionals, loops, methods, classes, and the Java Collection Framework.
